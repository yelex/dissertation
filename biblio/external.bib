	abstract = {This paper develops a model of a monetary economy in which individual firms are subject to idiosyncratic productivity shocks as well as general inflation. Sellers can change price only by incurring a real “menu cost.” We calibrate this cost and the variance and autocorrelation of the idiosyncratic shock using a new U.S. data set of individual prices due to Klenow and Kryvtsov. The prediction of the calibrated model for the effects of high inflation on the frequency of price changes accords well with international evidence from various studies. The model is also used to conduct numerical experiments on the economy’s response to various shocks. In none of the simulations we conducted did monetary shocks induce large or persistent real responses.},

	abstract = {Online grocery platforms play an increasing role in many countries’ food sectors. However, little is known about their pricing strategies. Are online prices less rigid than prices in brick-and-mortar stores, as theoretical and empirical studies from non-food sectors suggest? What does an acquisition by an internet giant imply for price adjustments in a formerly traditional offline store? Using a large data set of daily Amazon Fresh price quotes, we analyze the frequency and magnitude of price changes online. We find highly frequent and mostly small price adjustments for all major food categories sold by Amazon Fresh. For products from Whole Foods Market, which was acquired by Amazon in 2017 and whose assortment has since then been distributed online and offline, price behavior is completely different: Prices continue to be sticky and to follow traditional offline retail pricing patterns. We conclude that Amazon has indeed introduced a new way of dynamic pricing into food retail. However, at least until now this change is limited to Amazon Fresh’s online channels and has not yet spread to the acquired Whole Foods Market stores.}

	abstract={During the coronavirus disease‐2019 pandemic, online grocery shopping experienced a never seen popularity in many countries. To study how the globally active online grocer Amazon Fresh reacted to this extraordinary demand increase, we analyzed a large dataset of daily price quotes for over 19,000 products for the customer location, Los Angeles. We found that contrary to the US consumer food price index, the overall price level at Amazon Fresh did not increase during the pandemic, but even slightly decreased for several product groups. Amazon seems to follow its low‐price strategy also in the grocery sector, even in times of high demand. However, during the lockdown phase, there were more price increases for certain highly demanded product groups such as frozen and prepared foods. Moreover, fewer prices were communicated as promotional prices. Because this change did not influence the general price level, we conclude that such promotional prices are used more as a marketing tool than as a price‐setting instrument.},

The data set covers a broad range of items typically sold over the Internet. It includes more than 5 million daily price quotes downloaded from price comparison web sites in France, Germany, Italy, the UK and the US. The following results emerge from our analysis. First, and contrary to the recent findings for common CPI data, Internet prices in the EU countries do not change less often than online prices in the US. Second, prices on the Internet are not necessarily more flexible than prices in traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Third, there is substantial heterogeneity in the frequency of price change across shop types and product categories. Fourth, the average price change on the Internet is relatively large, but smaller than the respective values reported for CPI data. Finally, panel logit estimates suggest that the likelihood of observing a price change is a function of both state- and time-dependent factors. JEL Classification: E31, L11},
